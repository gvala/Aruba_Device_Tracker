## 🚧 Current Status

**BETA** - This integration is in active development and testing.

## Features

- **Device Tracker** — marks devices home/away based on Wi-Fi association
- **Extra attributes per device:**
  - `MAC` — Client MAC Address
  - `Host name` — Client host name
  - `access_point` — which AP the device is connected to
  - `essid` — the SSID/network name
  - `ip_address` — current IP address
  - `os` — operating system detected by the IAP
  - `channel` — Wi-Fi channel
  - `signal` — signal strength
  - `speed` — link speed
- **Config Flow** — set up entirely from the HA UI, no YAML required
- **Track new devices toggle** — choose whether newly discovered devices are tracked by default (off by default)
- **Friendly name renaming** — rename any device via the HA entity registry

## Requirements

- Aruba Instant AOS 8.5.0+ (REST API support)
- Admin account for API
- REST API must be enabled on the IAP:

```
(Instant AP)(config)# allow-rest-api
(Instant AP)(config)# end
(Instant AP)# commit apply
```
